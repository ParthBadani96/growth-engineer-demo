## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Backend API running (see [hubspot-backend](../hubspot-backend))

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ParthBadani96/growth-engineer-demo.git
cd growth-engineer-demo

# Update API endpoint in index.html
# Line 450: const API_URL = 'https://your-backend.railway.app';

# Serve locally
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Or use any static file server

# Open browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Configuration

**Update these variables in `index.html`:**
```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://your-backend-url.railway.app';
const EXPERIMENT_NAME = 'landing_page_messaging';
const VARIANT = 'A'; // or 'B' for second variant
```

## ML Model Details

### Training Data
- **2,000 historical leads** from FinTech companies
- **15 features** per lead
- **Binary classification**: High-quality (score ≥ 60) vs Low-quality

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 87%
- **Precision**: 84%
- **Recall**: 89%
- **F1 Score**: 86%

## A/B Testing

### Current Experiment: Landing Page Messaging

**Hypothesis**: Finance executives respond better to risk-reduction messaging than speed messaging

**Variants:**
- **Variant A**: "Get Paid Faster. Know What's Coming." (Speed-focused)
- **Variant B**: "Stop Guessing. Start Growing." (Risk-focused)

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Page views
- Form submissions
- Conversion rate
- Time on page
- Bounce rate

**Statistical Method:**
- Chi-square test for independence
- Significance threshold: p < 0.05
- Minimum sample size: 400 per variant

## Integration Points

### Backend API
- `POST /api/submit-lead` - Submit new lead with enrichment
- `GET /api/experiment-results/:name` - Fetch A/B test results
- `POST /api/track-experiment` - Log experiment events

### HubSpot
- Automatic contact creation
- Deal generation based on score
- Task assignment for high-value leads

### Snowflake
- All leads synced to data warehouse
- Experiment events logged
- Attribution tracking
